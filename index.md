I am currently a research assistant professor in School of Computing (SoC), National University of Singapore (NUS). I am working in the Singapore Blockchain Innovation Programme (SBIP). I am part of the [Database Systems Research Group](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~dbsystem/), working with [Prof. Beng Chin Ooi](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~ooibc/) and [Prof. Xiaokui Xiao](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~xiaoxk/). My research interests include federated learning, data security and privacy, and decentralized digital identiy.

I obtained my PhD degree in Computer Science from Renmin University of China (RUC) in 2018, under the supervision of [Prof. Hong Chen](http://info.ruc.edu.cn/academic_professor.php?teacher_id=56). I was a visiting PhD student in Simon Fraser University (SFU), supervised by [Prof. Ke Wang](https://www.cs.sfu.ca/~wangk/). I received my Master's degree from Nanjing University of Science and Technology (NJUST), advised by [Prof. Yongli Wang](https://cs.njust.edu.cn/e4/15/c1730a189461/page.htm), and Bachelor's degree from Southwest University of Science and Technology (SWUST). I also worked in Ant Financial as a senior developer and 724 Research Institute of China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation as a software engineer.
