## Welcome to Yuncheng Wu's Homepage

I am currently a research fellow in School of Computing (SoC), National University of Singapore (NUS). I am part of the [Database Systems Research Group](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~dbsystem/), working with [Prof. Beng Chin Ooi](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~ooibc/) and [Prof. Xiaokui Xiao](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~xiaoxk/). I obtained my PhD degree in Computer Science from Renmin University of China in 2018, under the supervision of [Prof. Hong Chen](http://info.ruc.edu.cn/academic_professor.php?teacher_id=56). I was a visiting PhD student in Simon Fraser University (SFU), supervised by [Prof. Ke Wang](https://www.cs.sfu.ca/~wangk/). My research interests include federated learning, data security and privacy.
